Here, there were queer people as far as the eye could see.
...
They weren't all accepting.
After some dancing, I pushed my way to a water cooler.
A few wallflowers stood in a semicircle, forming an impenetrable wall around the cooler.
After raising my voice, one of the men spotted me and told his friend to move out of the way for the girl behind him.
I corrected him.
I wasn't a girl, and I did not want to be referred to in that way.
The man awkwardly chucked and waved me off. His friend cringed and moved, finally making a path to the water cooler.
The man watched me, music pulsing as I filled my cup.
...
His gaze annoyed me.
My cup filled, I turned to him and scowled.
He recoiled with a slow blink and a "What, man?"
Again with the misgendering. I corrected him again, firmer this time.
He muttered out a nonsense apology about how I didn't pass, but he supposed he would be better.
I scoffed and shoved my way past him and his posse.
I didn't hear the voice calling me, but I felt its owner's hand brush against my wrist. A squeak escaped my lips involuntarily as I turned to face the man who had moved for me earlier. 
He apologized for grabbing me profusely. 
It was genuine. 
I tuned out his apology on behalf of the jerk, who turned out to be his roommate. 
...
We both came to the club to make friends. Why not be friends? 
Despite our rocky introduction, I took him up on the offer. 
I'm glad I did. 
He became one of my best friends, and I'm all the more better for having met him.
