I was so unhappy when I was a girl.
I never identified with the expectations that came with being a woman.
Being a boy had little appeal to me, too.
I aligned with neither, and am happier outside the binary.
Not everyone understands.
...
My mother had my whole life imagined before I was even born.
I graduated later than most of my peers, a decision my mother was deeply displeased with.
I am paving my own path through life, though, and I'm thriving.
My friends are my greatest allies.
Bigotry is expected from outsiders, but often I face it within the LGBTQ+ community.
I don't fit the stereotype of a non-binary person and many queer people feel the need to remind me by misgendering me.
My friends always support me. When my strength fails and I grow weary, I know they have my back.
...
There have been many struggles in my life, but there have also been many victories.
I will keep going, and keep living as my truest, happiest self.
