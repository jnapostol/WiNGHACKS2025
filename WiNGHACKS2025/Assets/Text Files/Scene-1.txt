The sun's beams disturb my endless scroll through Chirpper.
The light offends my eyes.
After all these years, the sun still shines upon my childhood bed at just the right angle to blind me.
It's my first morning here after graduating and moving back home. 
...
I blink twice, as if I can shift the sun so that I won't have to move from the comfortable position I've been in for the last hour.
Obviously, the beams still blind me.
I snort and roll over, moving to Immediagram.
I see a classmate from college. He's posted pictures of himself over the years. 
...
"Huh, he used to be so small."
I used to be small too. My teachers used to call me the Tiny Terror. 
I was a scrawny rambunctious kid. 
I still fit in the bed of my youth. 
Now that I'm back home, it seems nothing much has changed, including my height. 
...
"sigh" I'm feeling so nostalgic.
...
What's that on my bed?
