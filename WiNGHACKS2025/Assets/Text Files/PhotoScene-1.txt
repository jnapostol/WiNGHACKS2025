I remember the day I told my lola that I wasn't a girl or a boy. 
The idea had been floating around in my mind for a while. That day was no different.  
I was working on my math homework, probably struggling with decimals or fractions at the dinner table. She was sitting next to me, staring at the old thirteen inch TV at the end of the table. 
Frustrated, I dropped my pencil and placed my forehead on the table.
She cast her gaze on me and stroked my hair, saying "dalagang pilipina na", meaning "you're a grown lady now".
I winced.
It was something she always said to me when I was struggling and every time, the words were said with such love.
I looked at her and explained that I didn't want to be dalagang pilipina. She looked pained, but before she could speak, I kept going. 
I didn't want to be seen as a lalaki either. I didn't feel comfortable with either, but I still wanted to be her apo. 
She softened at that sentiment. She placed a gentle kiss and wiped my tears away. 
I think she understood what I meant.
