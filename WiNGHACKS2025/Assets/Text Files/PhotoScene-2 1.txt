"My 18th birthday was supposed to be a special occasion." 
An event of line dancing, gift giving, and celebrating me, I'd been dreading wearing my outfit for weeks. 
My mother was less accepting than my grandmother. 
In private, she tolerated my gender nonconformity. 
My whole family was set to attend the lavish Debut she planned. 
We argued over the outfit constantly. She would cite our family and I would invoke my grandmother. 
In the end, I didn't have a choice. 
My hair was styled, the dress was bought, and I was forced to wear it. 
I danced as much as was required of me, had pictures taken, and moped for the rest of the night.  
It's not a night I enjoy thinking about. 
...
My mom apologized years later, and I still haven't forgiven her.
